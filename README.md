Weather Application
This Weather Application is a user-friendly React-based web app that provides real-time weather updates for cities around the world. By leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API, the app fetches live data to display essential weather details, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and geographical coordinates. The app enhances the user experience by showing dynamic weather icons that correspond to current weather conditions such as clear skies, rain, or snow.

The application features a clean and responsive design, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes. Users can search for weather details by entering a city name in the search bar, with the app providing real-time feedback for valid and invalid city searches. The app handles errors gracefully, notifying users if the searched city is not found.

Technologies used in this project include React for building the interface and managing the application's state, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the core functionality. The OpenWeatherMap API is utilized for fetching accurate and reliable weather data. This project serves as an excellent learning experience for developers aiming to understand API integration, React components, and state management while building an interactive and visually appealing web application.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use this project to enhance your understanding of modern web development!
